# DEVELOPMENT.md

## Purpose

This file covers local setup, developer workflow, config handling, and operator commands.

If you want the product overview, start with [README.md](./README.md). If you want the technical model and system boundaries, use [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Runtime Model

- The app runs on the host with Bun and Next.js
- Postgres runs in Docker Compose for local development
- Drizzle is the ORM and typed query layer for Postgres
- Per-worktree ports are derived by `scripts/worktree-ports.ts`
- `bun dev` writes `.env` for the current worktree and starts Next on the derived port

## Prerequisites

- Bun
- Docker Desktop or another local Docker runtime

## Quick Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. See the derived ports for this worktree:

   ```bash
   bun run ports
   ```

3. Start local Postgres:

   ```bash
   bun run db:start
   ```

4. Optional: create a private local config override:

   ```bash
   cp config/config.example.json config/config.json
   ```

   `config/config.json` is gitignored and may include local-only ICS `url` values.

5. Start the app:

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

6. Run `bun run ports` again if you need the exact local URL for this worktree.

## Config And Secrets

Treat config as three layers:

1. Checked-in structural config in `config/config.example.json`
2. Secrets in env such as `ICS_URL_*`, `DATABASE_URL`, `VIEWER_PASSWORD`
3. Mutable runtime state in Postgres

Important rules:

- Do not commit real ICS URLs, signing secrets, mail credentials, or private instance config files
- Checked-in config should keep using env-managed ICS URLs by variable name
- `config/config.json` may inline a direct ICS `url` for private local development only
- Viewer page passwords belong in env, not checked-in config
- The current deployment model supports multiple houses in one app instance, so keep viewer access global unless the feature explicitly changes that model

Useful config fields to know:

- `people[].defaultRoomId` sets the default occupied room for parsed `presence.in` events unless the title explicitly says `not staying`
- `calendarInterpretation.allDayEndDateMode` controls whether imported all-day ICS end dates use standard exclusive semantics or checkout-day semantics for availability
- `calendarDisplay.timedNotes.enabled` controls whether timed viewer notes appear in the calendar UI; it defaults to `false`
- `calendarDisplay.timedNotes.showTime` controls whether timed viewer notes show their time range
- `calendarDisplay.timedNotes.textSource` controls whether timed viewer notes use the event title, description, or both
- `site.branding.faviconPath` should point at a local asset under `public/`

## Day-To-Day Commands

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

See the derived worktree ports:

```bash
bun run ports
```

Write `.env` for this worktree:

```bash
bun run ports:write
```

Start Postgres in Docker Compose:

```bash
bun run db:start
```

Stop Postgres:

```bash
bun run db:stop
```

Tail Postgres logs:

```bash
bun run db:logs
```

Start the app on the host:

```bash
bun dev
```

Run the full local verification flow:

```bash
bun run check
```

Run lint only:

```bash
bun run lint
```

Format the repo:

```bash
bun run format
```

Generate a Drizzle migration from schema changes:

```bash
bun run db:generate
```

Push schema changes directly to the database:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Do not replace the wrapped typecheck flow with raw `tsc --noEmit`. This repo uses `scripts/typecheck.ts` because of Next route type generation behavior.

## Admin Auth And Local Operator Flow

The app uses a small password-first admin model. SMTP is not required.

Generate a one-time bootstrap code:

```bash
bun run admin:bootstrap-code
```

Create a local-only admin account without using the setup page:

```bash
bun run admin:bootstrap-dev -- --email owner@example.com --password 'correct horse battery staple'
```

Reset the existing admin password and revoke all admin sessions:

```bash
bun run admin:reset-password -- --email owner@example.com --password 'new strong password'
```

Minimal local setup flow:

1. Run `bun run db:start`
2. Run `bun run admin:bootstrap-code`
3. Open `/admin/setup`
4. Create the single admin account
5. Use `/admin/login` for normal password login afterward

## Current Calendar Sync Behavior

- ICS imports are cached in-process with a short TTL
- `POST /admin/{siteId}/sync` forces a refresh and resets that house cache entry
- Cache state is not persisted yet, so restarting the app clears it
- Sample fallback is development-only when a site imports zero all-day ICS events; production should show the real empty state with warnings

## Calendar Authoring Tips

When you want to control what viewers see, treat the source calendar as having
two different jobs:

- All-day events drive occupancy interpretation.
- Short timed events can act as optional day notes for viewers.

Recommended patterns:

- Use all-day titles like `Someone stays (guest room)` or `Someone stays (whole house)` for actual overnight occupancy.
- Use `maybe stay` or `(tentative)` when the stay is not confirmed.
- Use housemate presence titles that match your configured rules, such as `Michael (TPE)` or `Michael in Tokyo (not staying)`.
- Use timed events like `Cleaner 1pm-3:30pm JST` only for logistics you are comfortable showing to trusted viewers.

Privacy rules for timed events:

- Timed notes are displayed to viewers using the event title as written.
- ICS events with `CLASS:PRIVATE` or `CLASS:CONFIDENTIAL` are imported but skipped in the viewer note UI.
- Timed notes never mark a room occupied and never change whole-house availability on their own.

## Local Database Notes

Only Postgres is containerized locally.

- [compose.yml](./compose.yml) starts a local `postgres:18-alpine`
- [scripts/worktree-ports.ts](./scripts/worktree-ports.ts) derives unique app and database ports from the worktree path
- [scripts/dev.ts](./scripts/dev.ts) writes `.env` and starts Next.js on the derived port
- [src/lib/server/db-schema.ts](./src/lib/server/db-schema.ts) is the Drizzle schema source

For local dev, the generated defaults are:

- `POSTGRES_DB=house_calendar`
- `POSTGRES_USER=house_calendar`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=house_calendar`

You can override those by exporting env vars before running the scripts.
