# DEPLOYMENT.md

## Purpose

This guide covers the minimum pieces needed to run `house-calendar` outside local development without assuming a specific host or platform.

Use [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for local setup and [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the system model.

## What A Deployment Needs

At a minimum, a deployment needs:

- one running app instance
- one Postgres database
- a `DATABASE_URL` that points at that database
- a real app config file at `config/config.json`
- any secret env vars referenced by that config, such as `ICS_URL_*`

If viewer password protection is enabled, it also needs:

- `VIEWER_PASSWORD`

## Required Environment

Set `DATABASE_URL` to your production or hosted Postgres connection string.

Example:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db-host:5432/house_calendar
```

If your config uses password-protected viewer access, also set:

```bash
VIEWER_PASSWORD=choose-a-strong-shared-password
```

Other env vars depend on your config. Common examples are:

```bash
ICS_URL_TOKYO=https://example.com/private-feed.ics
ICS_URL_TAIWAN=https://example.com/private-feed.ics
```

`ICS_SYNC_TTL_MINUTES` is optional if you want to override the default in-memory sync cache TTL.

## App Config

Do not rely on `config/config.example.json` as your real deployment config.

For deployment, make sure `config/config.json` is provided somehow. The app reads that file when present and falls back to the checked-in example only when it is missing.

Common ways to provide `config/config.json`:

- build it into the deployed artifact as a non-secret structural config file
- mount it at runtime from a volume or file secret
- generate it during deploy from a template and deployment variables
- sync it onto the host as part of your release process

The exact mechanism is up to your hosting setup. The important part is that the file exists at:

```text
config/config.json
```

## Config Rules For Deployment

Keep the config split intact:

- checked-in structure can live in `config/config.example.json`
- deployment-specific structure should live in `config/config.json`
- secrets should stay in env, not in checked-in files

In practice that usually means:

- keep house/site structure, branding, rooms, people, and parsing rules in `config/config.json`
- keep sensitive ICS URLs in env by using `envVar` references in the config
- only inline ICS `url` values in `config/config.json` if your deployment model treats that file as private

If you use `viewerAccess.mode: "password"` in config, `VIEWER_PASSWORD` must also be set in env.

## Database

The app expects Postgres.

Before treating the deployment as live, make sure:

- the database is reachable from the app
- `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
- schema changes have been applied

If you are managing schema changes manually, use the repo’s Drizzle workflow rather than ad hoc SQL.

## Basic Rollout Shape

1. Provision Postgres
2. Set `DATABASE_URL`
3. Provide `config/config.json`
4. Set any referenced secret env vars such as `ICS_URL_*`
5. Set `VIEWER_PASSWORD` if viewer password gating is enabled
6. Deploy the app
7. Apply any required database schema changes
8. Open the app and verify the default site loads
9. Visit `/admin/setup` or use the bootstrap helper flow if admin auth has not been initialized yet

## Post-Deploy Checks

After deployment, verify:

- the app starts without config or env errors
- the expected house pages resolve
- calendar feeds load for each configured site
- viewer access behaves as intended for `public` or `password` mode
- admin login or setup works
- the sync action at `/admin/{siteId}/sync` completes successfully

## Notes

- The current calendar cache is in-memory and process-local, so restarts clear it
- Viewer access is deployment-global today, not house-scoped
- `config/config.json` should be treated as deployment state even when it contains only non-secret structure
